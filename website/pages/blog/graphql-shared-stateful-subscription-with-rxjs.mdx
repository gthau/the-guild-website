GraphQL has native support for subscriptions as schema operations. GraphQL subscriptions allow to receive continuous updates, usually implemented using a persistent WebSocket connection or Server-Sent Events.

Ideally we want subscriptions to be stateless and independent for every subscriber: when a subscriber subscribes to an entity, this subscription is independent from any other subscription and can be handled by any instance of our GraphQL server. This is the case when the entity subscribed to is "simple" and processing updates is trivial: for example, we receive events from a pubsub provider / message queue (e.g. Redis, Nats.io, etc.) in the form ```{ type: update, entityId: xyz }```. In this case, our subscription handler can simply subscribe to these events, filter on the requested `entityId` and forward those events (maybe a bit processed) to the subscriber.

However this ideal scenario is not always possible. We might have "complex" entities we want to subscribe to, e.g. views that are aggregates of data over several data sources. The view might be expensive to fetch and subscribing to the view's content updates might involve subscribing to multiple events and perform expensive processing and/or additional fetching in order to compute the updates and send them to the subscriber.

In this case, if multiple subscribers subscribe to the same view, the events' processing, additional fetching and computing would have to be done for each subscriber, which will lead to performance issues as the number of subscribers increases.

## Mutualizing the subscription's work
If the subscription is independent from the subscriber (e.g. the logged-in user) and only dependent upon the view, then we can mutualize the events' listening, buffering, processing, additional fetching and computing required to update the view. This work can be done once and the result delivered to each subscriber.

## A solution

### A simple example to illustrate the solution
In the following lines, we'll use a very simplified example in order to present the solution: a GraphQL subscription that produces sequential integers. Then we'll apply the solution to a more complex real-life example.

The solution to the simple example is implemented in this [repository](https://github.com/gthau/graphql-shared-subscriptions-with-rxjs).

### Using RXJS multicasting capabilities
By default observables are lazy and cold, meaning their side-effect are run only when a subscriber subscribes to the observable and for every subscriber the observable pipeline is executed.

In the following example, the http query will be executed twice: `query$` is a cold observable, no side-effect happens until a subscriber subscribes to it. When a second subscriber subscribes, the observable side-effect is re-executed.
```typescript
const query$ = httpClient.get('/path/to/some/resource');
query$.subscribe(console.log);
query$.subscribe(console.log);
```

This is in opposition to Promises which are eager and hot: in this example the http query is executed only once.
```typescript
const queryPromise = fetch('/path/to/some/resource');
queryPromise.then(console.log);
queryPromise.then(console.log);
```

However RXJS has multicasting capabilities to turn cold observables into hot observables. Using RXJS's multicasting operators, we can create observable pipelines which are shared: their side-effect is triggered when the first subscriber subscribes to it and when more than one subscriber subscribe, the pipeline is executed only once and the emitted value is passed to all subscribers.

Let's see an example:
```typescript
const obs$ = interval(1000); // observable emitting 0, 1, 2, ... every second
obs$.subscribe(console.log); // prints 0, 1, 2, ...

setTimeout(() => obs$.subscribe(console.log), 3000); // after 3 seconds, prints 0, 1, 2, ...
```

However, using the [`share`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/share) operator, the observable pipeline is executed once and the second subscriber (even subscribing later), gets the same (shared) result as the first subscriber.
```typescript
const obs$ = interval(1000).pipe(share()); // observable emitting 0, 1, 2, ... every second
obs$.subscribe(console.log); // prints 0, 1, 2, ...

setTimeout(() => obs$.subscribe(console.log), 3000); // after 3 seconds, prints 3, 4, 5 ...
```

## Sharing the observables
In the simple example above, we have multiple subscribers subscribing to a shared observable, in the same context of execution. However, in GraphQL subscriptions, the 2nd (or nth) subscriber will have its own context of execution. If we want to reuse a shared observable, we have to store it.

Let's create a module to manage the subscriptions' shared observables:
```typescript
// util function to get or create a publisher
// takes a "cache" of publisher and a factory function and returns a higher-order function to get or create from this cache
export const getOrCreatePublisher = (publishersMap, makePublisherFn) => (entityId) => {
  if (publishersMap.has(entityId)) {
    return publishersMap.get(entityId)!;
  }

  const newPublisher = makePublisherFn(entityId);
  publishersMap.set(entityId, newPublisher);
  return newPublisher;
};
```

```typescript
// assuming that the entityId is a number, and the shared observable emits numbers
const publishersMap = new Map<number, Observable<number>>();

const makePublisher = (entityId: number): Observable<number> => {
  return interval(1000).pipe(share());
}

export const getPublisher = getOrCreatePublisher(publishersMap, makePublisher);

```

Now from the our GraphQL's subscription resolver, we can use it:
```graphql
type Subscription {
  giveMeInts: Int!
}
```

```typescript
{
  resolvers: {
    Subscription: {
      giveMeInts: {
        subscribe(root, args, context) {
          return eachValueFrom(
            getPublisher(args.entityId)
          );
        },
        resolve(root, args, context) {
          return root;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With this code, when a subscriber subscribes, it will create the shared observable (publisher), store it in a cache so that it can be reused by subsequent subscribers, and subscribe to it. When a second subscriber subscribes, it will get the existing publisher from the cache and subscribe to it, and it will get the same value as the first subscriber gets. When all subscribers have unsubscribed, the source observable is unsubscribed. If later, a new subscriber subscribes, the source observable will be resubscribed and its pipeline reexecuted (in our case, it will start emitting from 0 again).

<Callout type="info">
  The graphql-js engine expects the `subscribe` handler to return an AsyncIterable, so we use the [`rxjs-for-await` package from Ben Lesh](https://github.com/benlesh/rxjs-for-await) which contains different functions from transforming an Observable into an AsyncIterable (there are different functions to deal with backpressure and lossiness/losslessness).
</Callout>

So far, so good. But we have a memory leak: after all subscribers have unsubscribed, we keep the publishers in the cache. We can clean those up using the [`finalize`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/finalize) operator: this operator allows to run a callback on observable termination (either the observable is complete or has no more subscribers).

Let's modify our publisher factory function:
```typescript
const makePublisher = (entityId: number): Observable<number> => {
  return interval(1000).pipe(
    // clean up publisher cache when no more subscribers to this publisher
    finalize(() => publishersMap.delete(entityId)),
    share(),
  );
};
```

### Delay the shared observable cleanup

Because the view might be expensive to fetch and update, we only do so when users are subscribing to it. In the previous example, as soon as all users have unsubscribed, the shared observable is unsubscribed and deleted from the cache. This might not be the desired behavior, e.g.:
- we can have one user subscribing to the view, this user refreshes his browser's page, effectively ending the subscription, triggering a cache cleanup, but then the view is resubscribed almost immediately, triggering a new fresh fetch
- we can have one user stopping the subscription (e.g. navigating away from this view to another part of our app), but another user subscribing soon (a few milliseconds, seconds or minutes) after

To optimize for those use cases, we can delay the unsubscription of the shared observable when no more subscriber are subscribing to it, using the `resetOnRefCountZero` config of the `share` operator. This is available in RXJS v7.

```typescript
const makePublisher = (entityId: number): Observable<number> => {
  return interval(1000).pipe(
    // clean up publisher cache when no more subscribers to this publisher
    finalize(() => publishersMap.delete(entityId)),
    share({
      // when no more subscribers, wait 10 seconds to unsubscribe from the source and reset the underlying subject
      resetOnRefCountZero: () => timer(10_000),
    }),
  );
};
```

In the example above, after all subscribers have unsubscribed (`refcount` is 0) the connector (the subject that subscribes to the source observable) now waits for 10 seconds (10000 ms) before it resets the shared observable. During this period of time, the observable pipeline continues to execute. If a new subscriber subscribes before the `timer` has emitted, the `refcount` is again greater than 0 and the connector will keep connecting to the source observable.

<Callout type="warning">
  We use `timer` in this example but we can use any observable (e.g. receiving a specific event from our message queue) that emits at some point. Be careful though to make sure that the observable you use will actually emit otherwise you'll have a memory leak. To remedy this issue, you might want to add a safety, e.g. using [`raceWith`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/raceWith) with `timer` to make sure you don't wait indefinitely:

```typescript
share({
  // when no more subscribers, wait for 'my_event' up to 1 minute then unsubscribe from the source and reset the underlying subject
  resetOnRefCountZero: () => pubsub.events('my_event').pipe(
    raceWith(timer(60_000)),
  ),
}),
```
</Callout>

## Apply to a real-life example

Let's consider a view such as a complex "playlist": this playlist is a list of items organized in blocks, the items themselves are a complex aggregate of several multimedia (video, audio, graphics) objects, those multimedia objects themselves might be aggregate (bundles) or have of some children objects (e.g. sub-clips, graphics on a video, subtitles). In effect this complex playlist is organized in the form of a tree of objects.

The system emits different events:
- some are related directly to the playlist itself (e.g. new item in playlist, item removed from playlist, item changed position inside playlist)
- others are related to the parent multimedia objects (object deleted, object's metadata changed, object has new children objects)
- others are related to the children objects of the top level objects (object deleted, object's metadata changed)

This playlist's data is expensive to fetch, can be large and is cached only when users subscribe to it: because it is expensive to compute updates, we want to ensure we don't process events for all playlists in the system, only the ones some user is currently interested in.

Let's reuse the techniques explained above.

### Buffer events

First we'll buffer the events, dedupe them and share the observable because those events will be checked against every playlist subscribed to, so we can share the buffering and deduplication:

```typescript
// utils
export const isNotEmpty = <T>({ length }: ArrayLike<T>) => length > 0;
```

```typescript
const playlistEventNames = ['playlist_event_1', 'playlist_event_2', 'playlist_event_n'] as const;
const objectsEventNames = ['objects_event_1', 'objects_event_2', 'objects_event_n'] as const;

function bufferEvents(eventNames, bufferTime = 500) {
  return from(pubsub.events(eventNames)).pipe(
    buffer(bufferTime),
    filter(isNotEmpty),
    share(),
  );
}

const allPlaylistEvents$ = bufferEvents(playlistEventNames);
const allObjectsEvents$ = bufferEvents(objectsEventNames);
```

### Create shared publishers for the playlists' structure changes

In this example, we'll assume that the datasource is the source of truth, we'll listen to events to detect potential changes in the playlist and we'll force refetch (invalidate cache and fetch latest version) from the datasource (assuming calls are deduped using a Dataloader backed by a cache).

```typescript
const playlistStructureMap = new Map<number, Observable<PlaylistStructure>>();

export const getPlaylistStructurePublisher = getOrCreatePublisher(
  playlistStructureMap,
  makePlaylistStructurePublisher
);

function makePlaylistStructurePublisher(playlistId: number): Observable<boolean> {
  const playlistEvents$ = allPlaylistEvents$.pipe(
    map((events) => events.filter((ev) => ev.playlistId === playlistId)),
    filter(isNotEmpty),
  );

  const playlistObjectsEvents$ = allObjectsEvents.pipe(
    // this function filter the events that can have an impact on the structure of the playlist
    // e.g. "object has a new child object"
    // and discard other events that have no impact on the structure
    // e.g. "object name has changed"
    map((events) => filterObjectEventsThatAffectPlaylistStructure(events)),
    // only keeps events where the objectId refers to an object that belongs to this playlist's structure
    map((events) => filterObjectsThatBelongToPlaylist(events, playlistId)),
    filter(isNotEmpty),
  );

  return merge(
    playlistEvents$,
    playlistObjectsEvents$
  ).pipe(
    // buffer because both source observables might emit shortly one after another
    bufferTime(500),
    filter(isNotEmpty),
    // fetchPlaylistStructure is a function backed by a dataloader with cache
    // passing `true` as 2nd param to force fetch from datasource instead of cache
    switchMap((_) => fetchPlaylistStructure(playlistId, true)),
    // remove publisher from cache after it's been unsubscribed
    finalize(() => {
      console.debug(`Shared playlistStructurePublisher[playlist=${playlistId}] has finalized, removing it from cache`);
      playlistStructureMap.delete(playlistId);
    }),
    share({
      // keep subscribing for 1 minute after last subscriber unsubscribes
      resetOnRefCountZero: () => timer(60_000),
    }),
  );
}
```

### Writing the subscription's resolver

Now that we have all the subscription's required logic encapsulated and data processing shared, let's use it from the subscription's resolver:

```graphql
type Subscription {
  playlistStructureUpdates(playlistId: Int): PlaylistStructure!
}
```

```typescript
{
  resolvers: {
    Subscription: {
      playlistStructureUpdates: {
        subscribe(root, args, context) {
          return eachValueFrom(
            getPlaylistStructurePublisher(args.playlistId)
          );
        },
        resolve(root, args, context) {
          return root;
        }
      },
    },
  },
}
```

# Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how to use RXJS (or the reactive programming library of your choice) in order to mutualize the generation of expensive-to-produce values for a GraphQL subscription but also to trigger this processing on-demand whenever a consumer is interested in subscribing to a specific entity updates and stop it (with or without delay) when there are no more subscribers. Note that this technique is not exclusive to GraphQL subscriptions and can be used for any kind of subscriptions.
